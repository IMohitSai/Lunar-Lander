# Lunar-Lander
This project implements a Deep Learning-based agent to autonomously land a lunar module in the OpenAI Gym LunarLander-v2 environment. The agent is trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to optimize landing strategies with precision and efficiency.
