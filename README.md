Lunar Lander Using Deep Learning 🚀
This project implements a Deep Learning-based agent to autonomously land a lunar module in the OpenAI Gym LunarLander-v2 environment. The agent is trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to optimize landing strategies with precision and efficiency.

Features
🧠 Deep Q-Network (DQN) with experience replay for efficient learning
📊 Custom reward shaping to encourage soft landings
🏗 PyTorch/TensorFlow implementation for neural network training
🎮 Integration with OpenAI Gym for real-time simulation
📈 Performance tracking with Matplotlib
